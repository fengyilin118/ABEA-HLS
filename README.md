# FPGA accelerator for ABEA using HLS

Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) stands as a crucial algorithmic component in sequence polishing and DNA methylation detection, employing a dynamic programming strategy to align raw Nanopore signal to reference reads. ABEA was first introduced by [Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) and it is the bottleneck for both nanopolish call-methylation module and nanopolish eventalign module. The proposed accelerator with Xilinx Vivado High-Level Synthesis (HLS) targets Xilinx UV9P FPGA board and was implemented based on GPU accleration [f5c](https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c). The proposed accelerator obtains an average throughput speedup of 10.9 $\times$ over the CPU-only implementation, and an average 1.82 $\times$ speedup over the-state-of-art GPU acceleration with 3.8\% of the energy.

 **Dataset**

 `Nanopore WGS Consortium' sequencing dataset was used to conduct our evaluation, which can downloaded from [Whole Human Genome Sequencing Project](https://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/NA12878/blob/master/Genome.md). Specifically, we chose five individual flowcells FAB39088, FAB42395, FAB41174, FAF05869 and FAF18554.
 
 GRCh38/hg38 [hg38 FASTA Human Reference Genome](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ur3xybIzQGSxuqeByyp5OMrpaRJXCsMI/view?usp=sharing) was used as the reference genomes for alignment.
 
  **Usage**
  
The FPGA configuration file is in the binary directory. The host calls two kernel functions implemented in the configuration file.
