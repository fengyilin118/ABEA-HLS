# FPGA accelerator for ABEA using HLS

 Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) stands as a crucial algorithmic component in sequence polishing and DNA methylation detection, employing a dynamic programming strategy to align raw Nanopore signal to reference reads. ABEA was first introduced by [Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) and it is the bottleneck for both nanopolish call-methylation module and nanopolish eventalign.
